    "Description": "The fMRI data here is a denoised version of the original one in the studyforrest project (datails in RawSources).  A four-step denoising procedure including 1.preprocessing (motion correction, slice timing correction, brain extraction, high-pass temporal filtering [200s cutoff] and spatial smoothing [Gaussian kernel; FWHM = 5 mm] with FEAT in FSL v6.00), 2.ICA decomposition (with FSL's MELODIC v3.15), 3.IC manual classification and 4.artefacts removal (with fsl_regfilt in FSL's MELODIC v3.15) were applied.
