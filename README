A denoised audio-visual movie watching fMRI data in studyforrest dataset

The data presented here are related to the 3T movie-watching fMRI data in the studyforrest project. A four-step denoising procedure including preprocessing, ICA decomposition, IC classification and artefacts removal were applied on the movie-watching fMRI data in the studyforrest dataset, producing a denoised version of that. The datset is structured in BIDS format.
