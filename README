A denoised audio-visual movie watching fMRI data in studyforrest dataset
========================================================================

The data presented here are related to the 3T movie-watching fMRI data in 
the studyforrest project(https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds001293).

A four-step denoising procedure including preprocessing, 
ICA decomposition, IC classification and artefacts removal were applied 
on the movie-watching fMRI data in the studyforrest dataset, producing a 
denoised version of that. 

After the four-stage data cleanup procedure, 3 kinds of data were produced for 
each run of each participant. 
1. the denoised fMRI data
	named 'sub­xx_ses-movie_task-movieDenoisedSm5/movieDenoisedUnsm_run-xx_bold.nii.gz'
2. ICs decomposed from the original data named 
	named 'sub­xx_ses-movie_task-movieDenoisedSm5/movieDenoisedUnsm_run-xx_bold_IC.nii.gz'
3. the corresponding label file of each IC file
	named 'sub­xx_ses-movie_task-movieDenoisedSm5/movieDenoisedUnsm_run-xx_bold_IC_labels.txt'
