A denoised audio-visual movie watching fMRI data in studyforrest dataset

Note: This dataset is compatible with the BIDS v1.3.0-dev as a standalone 
derivative dataset. Due to that the OpenNeuro.org does not support 
the BIDs v1.3.0 yet(_desc-<label> in file names), a made-up subject 
'sub-phantom' was created only to pass the data stucture validation 
for uploading dataset.

Source data
===========
We here provide a denoised version of the 3T movie-watching fMRI raw data 
in the studyforrest project (https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000113). 
The raw data was originally hosted on OpenfMRI.org as ds000113d. 
However, ds000113d on OpenfMRI.org has been combined along with other 
related datasets and now is simply referred to as ds000113 on OpenNeuro.org.

Pipeline description
====================
A four-step denoising procedure were applied on the movie-watching 
fMRI data in the studyforrest dataset, producing a denoised version of that.  
1. Preprocessing: motion correction, slice timing correction, brain extraction, 
high-pass temporal filtering (200s cutoff) and OPTIONAL spatial smoothing 
(Gaussian kernel; FWHM = 5 mm) with FEAT in FSL v6.00  
2. ICA decomposition: with FSL’s MELODIC v3.15  
3. IC manual classification  
4. Artefacts removal: with fsl_regfilt in FSL’s MELODIC v3.15

Dataset content overview
========================
After the four-step denoising procedure, 4 kinds of data were produced 
for each run of each participant.

2. spatial maps of decomposed ICs
