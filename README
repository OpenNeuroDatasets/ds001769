A denoised audio-visual movie watching fMRI data in studyforrest dataset

Note: This dataset is compatible with the BIDS v1.3.0-dev as a standalone derivative dataset. 
Due to that the OpenNeuro.org does not support the BIDs v1.3.0 yet ('desc-<label>' in file names), 
a made-up subject 'sub-phantom' was created only to pass the data stucture validation for uploading dataset.

Source data
===========
We here provide a denoised version of the studyforrest 3T movie-watching fMRI data. 
Specifically, the studyforrest 3T movie-watching fMRI dataset was hosted as ‘ses-movie’ 
under OpenNeuro ds000113 (https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000113). Historically, the studyforrest 
3T movie-watching fMRI data was hosted as ds000113d on OpenfMRI (https://legacy.openfmri.org/dataset/ds000113d/). 
It shall be noted that ‘ses-movie’ under OpenNeuro ds000113 and OpenfMRI ds000113d are the same data, just different in names.

Pipeline description
====================
A four-step procedure was used to denoise the movie-watching fMRI data from the studyforrest project, 
producing a denoised version of the data.  

1. The data were preprocessed using FEAT in FSL v6.00 (https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FEAT) 
including motion correction, slice timing correction, brain extraction, high-pass temporal filtering (200s cutoff) 
and with or without spatial smoothing (i.e., FWHM= 5 mm or FWHM=0 mm).  
2. ICA was performed with MELODIC v3.15 (https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/MELODIC).  
3. IC classification was manually performed using melview (https://git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/melview).  
4. Artefact removal was performed using fsl_regfilt in FSL’s MELODIC v3.15.
